# Greed
- Socrates - says "He who is not contented with what he has,
would not be contented with what he would like to have." 
Greed is a game in which the player seeks to gather as many falling gems as possible. Take risks, push the limit, and get greedy in this game. But don't get too greedy or you'll lose it all!
It's easy to play. Gems and rocks fall from the top screen. Move left or right along the bottom screen. Touch the gem and earn a point. Touch the rock and lose a point. Gems disappear as you touch them. You have control, so you end the game when you want.
## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
